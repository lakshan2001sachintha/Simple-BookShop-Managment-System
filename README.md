🚀 **Project Highlight: Simple Book Management System**

I'm excited to share a recent project I developed — a **Simple Book Management System** featuring full **Create, Update, and Delete (CUAD)** operations, along with a secure **User Registration and Login** system.

🔧 **Tech Stack:**
🔹 **Frontend:** JSP, HTML, CSS
🔹 **Backend:** Java Servlets
🔹 **Database:** MySQL

📚 The application allows users to:
✔️ Register and log in securely
✔️ Add new books
✔️ Edit book details
✔️ Delete books
✔️ View a list of all books in the system

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in web development, MVC architecture, database integration, and session handling using Java EE technologies.

I'd love to hear your feedback or suggestions for improvements!
